    <h1>The Demonlist Rules</h1>
    <p>The guidelines that the Demon List follows while managing new level placements and incoming record submissions are described in this section of the page. Please take note that while these guidelines go into great detail on the several aspects of the list and the Team, they are not necessarily exhaustive and may be updated anytime the Team deems the need to. The changelog should be carefully studied by players, so they are aware of any most current additions or changes before these updates are implemented.</p>
    <p>Please feel free to ask any Team member for clarification if you have any questions or issues regarding these rules.</p>
    <p>Join the official DOUGDPS' <a class="link" href="CoomSoon">Demon List Discord Server</a> and head to <b>#XD</b> if you request help with your records or anything else.</p>
    <br>
    <!-- ================================== -->
    <h2>Records</h2>
    <li>Records that are provided can show when a player completes a level or progresses past the minimum requirement. The page at that level on the list contains the minimal requirements for each demon on the given list.</li>
    <li>The player's <b>own</b> records should be submitted, along with an uncut video of their progress or completion. The List does not accept any other video-sharing websites; therefore, the video must be accessible via <b>Google Drive Links, YouTube, Twitch (only highlights)</b>, or those other three!</li>
    <li>Before to a record being automatically rejected, a player has at least a <b>week</b> to respond to a list team member's request regarding the record. If the player contacts a member of the team after this deadline date, the record will be reconsidered. List team members should inform you know if and why your record was denied. If the member doesn't let you know, get in touch with a more prominent member!</li>
    <br>
    <!-- ================================== -->
    <h2>Raw Footage</h2>
    <p>For all <b>Main-list Demon records (Top 1-50)</b>, raw footage is required. Unedited video files of the run, whether through a livestream or recording software, are referred to as raw footage.</p>
    <li>Any edited videos are not considered to be "raw footage"! Records containing edited raw footage will always be disqualified. However, if additional proof is presented to us, we'll take a second look at any rejected records.</li>
    <li>In the "Raw Footage" section of the submission form or in the video description, players who want to submit raw footage must include the file as a <b>shareable Google Drive link</b>. If you didn't give it to us, we won't contact you for the raw footage!</li>
    <br>
    <!-- ================================== -->
    <h2>Eligibility</h2>
    <li>Any record run must begin at the start of the level and continue until the submitted progress value. A record is still valid even if you quit the level in the middle of an attempt or just use one attempt in Practice Mode.</li>
    <li>It is necessary that there are <b>audible clicks</b> present throughout the entire run, whether the footage is finished or raw. A record without clicks will definitely be disregarded! Because there aren't any hacks yet, <b>mobile players</b> are exempt from this rule.</li>
    <li>It's typically acceptable to use a skip as long as it doesn't skip entire sections of the level or change its hardest parts, but players should be aware of whether the skip is still possible in the level's rated version.</li>
    <li>Unless the game crashes before the endscreen is shown, 100% records that don't show the in-game endscreen won't be included in the list. The list will not accept records with endscreens that are unreadable for any reason.</li>
    <br>
    <!-- ================================== -->
    <h2>Bannable Punishments</h2>
    <li>Players who pass off records using prohibited hacks as real will be blocked until they admit to hacking, and records utilizing those hacks won't be added to the list. A ban may also be enforced for not providing justification.</li>
    <p>The hacks (from the "Mega Hack") that we allow for records submitted to the list are listed in the following list. Any hack that is not on this list should be regarded as being prohibited by the players. Please feel free to get in touch with us through our Discord server if you think something should be added to this list!</p>

    <ul class="hacks">- Start Pos Switcher (from the start)</ul>
    <ul class="hacks">- Trail Always Off</ul>
    <ul class="hacks">- Trail Always On (only for levels without a section where the Hide Player trigger is available)</ul>
    <ul class="hacks">- Void Click Bug Fix</ul>
    <ul class="hacks">- Wave Pulse Size (just to reduce the wave pulse size; not to increase the size)</ul>
    <ul class="hacks">- Wave Trail Bug Fix</ul>
    <br>
    <li>In general, if a level becomes unreasonable more difficult or impossible as a result of varying refresh rates or in-game physics changes, players are free to fix the bug. A player ban could occur if they regularly submit illegitimate bugfixes without getting team approval.</li>
    <br>
    <!-- ================================== -->
    <h2>Smooth Fix, Texture Packs, and LDMs</h2>
    <li>Records are always available for Low Detail Modes (LDMs) that are included in the original level, uploaded by the level's creator, or uploaded to the fartballs2 account. LDMs that have been submitted to the fartballs2 account are still valid as long as there isn't a more recent version listed. Players may also decide to create their own LDMs, but they should first get approval from the list team.</li>
    <li><b>Sharing a NoClip run</b> of the level with us is the best approach to clear an LDM with the list team. Players shouldn't just give a team member their level ID!</li>
    <li>It is not allowed to use the Smooth Fix to severely slow down the game. Additionally, it is prohibited to use texture packs that visibly change hitboxes other than the player's own.</li>
